= OpenAI compatibility for RAG APIs in Llama Stack

[role="_abstract"]
{productname-short} supports OpenAI-compatible request and response schemas for Llama Stack RAG workflows. You can use OpenAI clients and schemas for files, vector stores, and Responses API file search end-to-end.

OpenAI compatibility enables the following capabilities:

* You can use OpenAI SDKs and tools with Llama Stack by setting the client `base_url` to the Llama Stack OpenAI path, `/v1/openai/v1`. 
* You can manage files and vector stores by using OpenAI-compatible endpoints. You can then invoke RAG workflows by using the Responses API with the `file_search` tool.
