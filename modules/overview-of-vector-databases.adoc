= Overview of vector databases

[role="_abstract"]
Vector databases are a crucial component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in {productname-short}. They store and index vector embeddings that represent the semantic meaning of text or other data. When you integrate vector databases with Llama Stack in {productname-short}, you can build RAG applications that combine large language models (LLMs) with relevant, domain-specific knowledge.

Vector databases provide you with the following capabilities: 
* Store vector embeddings generated by embedding models.
* Support efficient similarity search to retrieve semantically related content.
* Enable RAG workflows by supplying the LLM with contextually relevant data from a specific domain.

When you deploy RAG workloads in {productname-short}, you can deploy vector databases through the Llama Stack Operator. Currently, {productname-short} supports the following vector databases:

* *Inline Milvus Lite*  
An Inline Milvus vector database runs embedded within the Llama Stack Distribution (LSD) pod and is suitable for lightweight experimentation and small-scale development. Inline Milvus stores data in a local SQLite database and is limited in scale and persistence.

* *Remote Milvus*  
A remote Milvus vector database runs as a standalone service in your project namespace or as an external managed deployment. Remote Milvus is recommended for production-grade RAG use cases because it provides persistence, scalability, and isolation from the Llama Stack Distribution (LSD) pod. In {openshift-platform} environments, you must deploy Milvus with an etcd service directly in your project. For more information on using etcd services, see https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-latest-version}/html/etcd/index[Providing redundancy with etcd]. 

Consider the following points when you decide on the vector database to use for your RAG workloads:

* Use **inline Milvus Lite** if you want to experiment quickly with RAG in a self-contained setup and do not require persistence across pod restarts.
* Use **remote Milvus** if you need reliable storage, high availability, and the ability to scale out RAG workloads in your {productname-short} environment.
