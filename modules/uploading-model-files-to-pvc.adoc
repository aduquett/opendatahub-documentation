= Uploading model files to a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

When deploying a model, you can serve it from a preexisting Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) where your model files are stored. You can upload your local model files to a PVC by using a running workbench.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {productname-short} dashboard.
* You have a running workbench.
* You have created a persistent volume claim (PVC) with a context type of model storage.

* The workbench is attached to the persistent volume (PVC), as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-project-workbenches_projects#creating-a-project-workbench_projects[Creating a project workbench].
endif::[]

* The workbench is attached to the persistent volume (PVC), as described in link:{odhdocshome}/working-on-data-science-projects/#creating-a-workbench-select-ide_projects[Creating a project workbench].

* You have the model files saved on your local machine.

.Procedure

Follow these steps to upload your model files to the PVC:

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, launch your running workbench.
. In the workbench interface, navigate to the *File Browser* pane on the left-hand side.
. Optional: Create a new folder to organize your models:
.. Click the **New Folder** icon.
.. Name the folder (for example, `models`).
.. Double-click the new `models` folder to enter it.
. Upload your model files:
.. Click the *Upload Files* icon in the *File Browser* toolbar.
.. Select the model files from your local computer.
.. Wait for the upload to complete. 

.Verification

* The files are saved on the PVC attached to your workbench.

.Next steps

When you follow the procedure to deploy a model, you can now select this model:

. In the *Deploy model* dialog, select *Existing cluster storage* under the *Source model location* section.
. From the *Cluster storage* list, select the PVC associated with your workbench.
. In the **Model path** field, enter the path to your model or the folder containing your model.
