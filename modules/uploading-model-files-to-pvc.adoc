= Uploading model files to a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

When deploying a model, you can serve it from a preexisting Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) where your model files are stored. You can upload your local model files to a PVC by using a running workbench.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {productname-short} dashboard.
* You have a running code-server or Jupyter workbench.
* You have created a persistent volume claim (PVC) with a context type of *Model storage*.
* The workbench is attached to the persistent volume (PVC).

* You have the model files saved on your local machine.

.Procedure

Follow these steps to upload your model files to the PVC mount point (`/opt/app-root/src/`) within your workbench:

. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click the open icon (image:images/open.png[The open icon]) to open your IDE in a new window.
. In your IDE, navigate to the *File Browser* pane on the left-hand side.
.. In Jupyter, this is usually labeled *Files*.
.. In Code-Server, this is usually the *Explorer* view.
. In the file browser, navigate to the `/opt/app-root/src/` directory. This directory represents the root of your attached PVC.
+
NOTE: Any files or folders you create or upload here will persist in the PVC.
. Optional: Create a new folder to organize your models:
.. Right-click within the `/opt/app-root/src/` directory in the file browser and select *New Folder*, or click the *New Folder* icon if available in the toolbar.
.. Name the folder (for example, `models`).
.. Double-click the new `models` folder to enter it.
. Upload your model files to the current directory (`/opt/app-root/src/` or `/opt/app-root/src/models/`):
* *Using Jupyter:*
.. Click the *Upload Files* icon (image:images/jupyterlab-upload.png[Upload files icon, title="Upload files icon"]) in the file browser toolbar above the directory listing.
.. In the file selection dialog, navigate to and select the model files from your local computer. Click *Open*.
.. Wait for the upload progress bars next to the filenames to complete.
* *Using Code-Server:*
.. Drag the model files directly from your local file explorer and drop them into the file browser pane in the desired directory within Code-Server.
. Wait for the upload process to complete. You might see progress notifications.

.Verification

You can verify the upload was successful by confirming that your files appear in the file browser at the path where you uploaded them.

.Next steps

When you follow the procedure to deploy a model, you can access the model files from the specified path within your PVC:

. In the *Deploy model* dialog, select *Existing cluster storage* under the *Source model location* section.
. From the *Cluster storage* list, select the PVC associated with your workbench.
. In the *Model path* field, enter the path to your model or the folder containing your model.
