[role='_abstract']
Detectors are the main building block of a guardrails pipeline, providing the actual judgement capabilities of guardrails. A detector analyzes text inputs, such as prompts from a user, and outputs, such as responses from a model, to identify and flag content that violates predefined rules. Examples of the kinds of things that are protected with guardrails are as follows: 

* Sensitive data
* Harmful language
* Prompt injection attacks

Any server that implements the link:https://foundation-model-stack.github.io/fms-guardrails-orchestrator/?urls.primaryName=Detector+API[IBM Detectors API] can be used as a detector.
