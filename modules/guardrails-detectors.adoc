[role='_abstract']
Detectors are the main building block of a guardrails pipeline, providing the actual “judgement” capabilities of guardrails. The primary function is to analyze text inputs, such as prompts from a user, and outputs, such as responses from a model, to identify and flag content that violates predefined rules, such as the presence of sensitive data, harmful language, or prompt injection attacks. Any server that implements the link:https://foundation-model-stack.github.io/fms-guardrails-orchestrator/?urls.primaryName=Detector+API[IBM Detectors API] can be used as a detector.
