= Viewing registered model versions

[role='_abstract']
You can view the details of model versions that are registered in {productname-short}, such as the version metadata and deployment information.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* An available model registry exists in your deployment, and contains at least 1 registered model.
* You have access to the model registry that contains the model version that you want to view.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *AI hub* -> *Registry*.
. From the *Model registry* drop-down list, select the model registry that contains the model version that you want to view.
. Click the name of a model to view *Overview* tab on the model details page, which includes the latest model versions and deployments. 
. On the *Versions* tab, you can view the registered versions of the model.
+
Versions are sorted by their *Last modified* timestamp by default.
. Use the search bar to find a version in the list. You can filter with a keyword by default by entering a model name, description, or label. Alternatively, click the search bar drop-down list and select *Author* to filter by entering a model owner.
+
Searching by keyword performs a search across the name, description, and labels of registered models and their versions.
. Click the name of a version to view the version details page.
. On the *Details* tab, you can view the *Version details* metadata, such as labels, description, custom properties, version ID, author, and last modified and registered timestamps. This also includes where the model is registered from, model location, and model format information. 
+
You can also click *Model details* to view non-version metadata, such as labels, description, owner, model ID, last modified and created timestamps, and custom properties.
. On the *Deployments* tab, you can view deployments initiated from the model registry for this version.
.. Click the name of a deployment to open its metrics page.
