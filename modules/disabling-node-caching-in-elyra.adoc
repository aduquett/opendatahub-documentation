= Disabling node caching in Elyra

[role='_abstract']
You can use the Elyra feature in {productname-short} to cache components, or "nodes", within your data pipelines. When a pipeline component runs, Elyra stores its outputs by default. In subsequent runs, if Elyra detects that a particular component has already been executed and its inputs have not changed, it reuses the cached outputs instead of re-running the entire component.

If you do not want your component output to be cached, you can disable this feature for a single node or for all of the nodes in your pipeline.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
* You have created a data science project.
* You have created and configured a pipeline server within the data science project that contains your workbench.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure that the runtime configuration is created by default, you must create the pipeline server before you create the workbench.

* You have created a workbench with a workbench image that contains the Elyra extension (Standard Data Science, TensorFlow, TrustyAI, ROCm-PyTorch, ROCm-TensorFlow, or PyTorch), as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_on_data_science_projects/using-project-workbenches_projects#creating-a-workbench-select-ide_projects[Creating a workbench and selecting an IDE].
* You have started the workbench and opened the JupyterLab interface, as described in link:{rhoaidocshome}{default-format-url}/working_in_your_data_science_ide/accessing-your-workbench-ide_ide[Accessing your workbench IDE].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Elyra pipeline editor is available in specific workbench images only. To use Elyra, the workbench must be based on a JupyterLab image that includes the Elyra extension. The Elyra extension is not available in code-server or RStudio IDEs, and it is not included in Minimal Python workbenches. Supported JupyterLab-based images such as Standard Data Science, TensorFlow, PyTorch, TrustyAI, and ROCm variants include the Elyra extension.
====
* You have access to S3-compatible storage.
* You have created a pipeline in JupyterLab.

.Procedure
. After you open JupyterLab, confirm that the JupyterLab launcher is automatically displayed.
. Open the pipeline that includes the nodes that you want to modify.
. Right-click the node that you want to edit, and then click *Open Properties*.
. To disable caching on a single node, complete the following steps:
.. Click the *Node Properties* tab in the slide-out menu on the right.
.. Under *Additional Properties*, click the option bar under *Disable node caching* that is automatically populated with *Use runtime default*.
.. Select *True*.
. To disable caching for all nodes on your pipeline, complete the following steps:
.. Click the *Pipeline Properties* tab in the slide-out menu on the right.
.. Under *Node Defaults*, click the option bar under *Disable node caching* that is automatically populated with *Use runtime default*.
.. Select *True*.

.Verification
* To verify that caching is disabled for a single node, check that node runs are re-executed in your target runtime environment.
* To verify that caching is disabled for all nodes on your pipeline, check that your entire pipeline runs are re-executed in your target runtime environment.
