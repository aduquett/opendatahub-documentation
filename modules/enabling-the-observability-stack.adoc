= Enabling the observability stack

[role="_abstract"]
The observability stack collects and correlates metrics, traces, and alerts for {productname-short} so that you can monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize {productname-short} components. A cluster administrator must explicitly enable this capability in the `DataScienceClusterInitialization` (DSCI) custom resource.

Once enabled, you can perform the following actions:

* Accelerate troubleshooting by viewing metrics, traces, and alerts for {productname-short} components in one place.
* Maintain platform stability by monitoring health and resource usage and receiving alerts for critical issues.
* Integrate with existing tools by exporting telemetry to third-party observability solutions through the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry.

.Prerequisites
* You have cluster administrator privileges for your {openshift-platform} cluster.
* You have installed {productname-long}.
* You have installed the following Operators, which provide the components of the observability stack:
** *Cluster Observability Operator*: Deploys and manages Prometheus and Alertmanager for metrics and alerts.
** *Tempo Operator*: Provides the Tempo backend for distributed tracing.
** *Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry*: Deploys the OpenTelemetry Collector for collecting and exporting telemetry data.

.Procedure
. Log in to the {openshift-platform} web console as a cluster administrator.
. In the {openshift-platform} console, click *Operators* → *Installed Operators*.
. Search for the *{productname-long}* Operator, and then click the Operator name to open the Operator details page.
. Click the *DSCInitialization* tab.
. Click the default instance name (for example, *default-dsci*) to open the instance details page.
. Click the *YAML* tab to show the instance specifications.
. In the `spec.monitoring` section, set the value of the `managementState` field to `Managed`, and configure metrics, alerting, and tracing settings as shown in the following example:

. Click *Save* to apply your changes.

.Verification

Verify that the observability stack components are running in the configured namespace:
. In the {openshift-platform} web console, click *Workloads* → *Pods*.
. From the project list, select *{monitoring-default-namespace}*.
. Confirm that there are running pods for your configuration. The following pods indicate that the observability stack is active:
+
[source,terminal]
----
alertmanager-data-science-monitoringstack-#      2/2   Running   0   1m
data-science-collector-collector-#               1/1   Running   0   1m
prometheus-data-science-monitoringstack-#        2/2   Running   0   1m
tempo-data-science-tempomonolithic-#             1/1   Running   0   1m
thanos-querier-data-science-thanos-querier-#     2/2   Running   0   1m
----

. Optional: Verify that metrics are collected from instrumented components by confirming that their pods include the label `monitoring.opendatahub.io/scrape='true'`.
