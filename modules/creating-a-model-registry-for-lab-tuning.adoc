= Creating a model registry for LAB-tuning

[role='_abstract']
Configure a model registry in {productname-short} so users can register base models, launch a LAB-tuning run, and manage tuned model versions from the dashboard.

A model registry is required to register base models and manage LAB-tuned models in {productname-short}. To start a LAB-tuning run, users must first register a base model from the model registry. The LAB-tune workflow is then launched directly from the model's detail page. In addition, after a LAB-tuning run completes, the resulting fine-tuned model can be automatically added to the registry where users can track versions, view metadata, and deploy the model.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to {productname-short} as a user with administrator privileges.
* The model registry component is enabled for your environment.

.Procedure
* Follow the steps described in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.19/html/managing_model_registries/creating-a-model-registry_managing-model-registries[Creating a model registry].
