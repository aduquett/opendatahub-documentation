= Collecting metrics from user workloads

[role="_abstract"]
After a cluster administrator enables the observability stack in your cluster, metric collection becomes available but is not automatically active for all deployed workloads.  
The monitoring system relies on a specific label to identify which pods Prometheus should scrape for metrics.

To include a workload, such as a user-created workbench, training job, or inference service, in the centralized observability stack, add the label `monitoring.opendatahub.io/scrape=true` to the pod template in the workload's deployment configuration.  
This ensures that all pods created by the deployment include the label and are automatically scraped by Prometheus.

[NOTE]
====
Apply the `monitoring.opendatahub.io/scrape=true` label only to workloads that expose metrics and that you want the observability stack to monitor.  
Do not add this label to operator-managed workloads, because the operator might overwrite or remove it during reconciliation.

.Prerequisites
* A cluster administrator has enabled the observability stack as described in _Enabling the observability stack_.
* You have {productname-short} administrator privileges or you are the project owner.
* You have deployed a workload that exposes a `/metrics` endpoint, such as a workbench server or model service pod.
* You have access to the project where the workload is running.

.Procedure
. Log in to the {openshift-platform} web console as a cluster administrator or project owner.
. Click *Workloads* → *Deployments*.
. In the *Project* list at the top of the page, select the project where your workload is deployed.
. Identify the deployment that you want to collect metrics from and click its name.
. On the *Deployment details* page, click the *Actions* menu (three vertical dots) in the top-right corner and select *Edit YAML*.
. In the YAML editor, locate the pod template specification by navigating to the following path:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
----
. Add the required scrape label under the `labels` section, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example_name
  namespace: example_namespace
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        monitoring.opendatahub.io/scrape: 'true'
# ...
----
. Click *Save*.
+
OpenShift automatically rolls out a new replica set and pods with the updated label. When the new pods start, the observability stack begins scraping their metrics.

.Verification
. In the {openshift-platform} web console, click *Observe* → *Metrics*.
. Open the *Prometheus* view or go to *Developer* → *Monitoring* to query metrics.
. In the query field, enter or select a metric that originates from your labeled workload.
+
If the label is applied correctly and the workload exposes metrics, you can view live metrics collected by the centralized Prometheus instance.
