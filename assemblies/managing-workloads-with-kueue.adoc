As a cluster administrator, you can manage AI and machine learning workloads at scale by integrating the {rhbok-productname} with {productname-long}. This integration provides capabilities for quota management, resource allocation, and prioritized job scheduling.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The embedded Kueue component for managing distributed workloads is deprecated. Kueue is now provided through {rhbok-productname}, which is installed and managed by the {rhbok-productname} Operator. You cannot install both the embedded Kueue and the {rhbok-productname} Operator on the same cluster because this creates conflicting controllers that manage the same resources.

{productname-short} does not automatically migrate existing workloads. To ensure your workloads continue using queue management after upgrading, cluster administrators must manually migrate from the embedded Kueue to the {rhbok-productname} Operator. For more information, see _Migrating to the {rhbok-productname} Operator_.
