= Managing workloads with Kueue

[role='_abstract']

As a cluster administrator, you can manage AI/ML workloads at scale by integrating the {rhbok-productname} with {productname-long}. This integration provides capabilities for quota management, resource allocation, and prioritized job scheduling.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname-short} 2.23 and earlier versions include an embedded Kueue component for managing distributed workloads. Starting with {productname-short} 2.24, the embedded Kueue component will be deprecated and Kueue will be provided through {rhbok-productname}, which is installed and managed by the {rhbok-productname} Operator.

You cannot install both the embedded Kueue and the {rhbok-productname} Operator on the same cluster because this creates conflicting controllers that manage the same resources.

{productname-short} does not automatically migrate existing workloads to {rhbok-productname}. Cluster administrators must manually migrate from the embedded Kueue to the {rhbok-productname} Operator to ensure workloads continue using queue management after upgrading. This configuration is supported in {productname-short} 2.23 as a Technology Preview feature.
