= Managing workloads with Kueue

[role='_abstract']

As a cluster administrator, you can manage AI/ML workloads at scale by integrating the {rhbok-productname} with {productname-long}. This integration provides capabilities for quota management, resource allocation, and prioritized job scheduling.

ifdef::upstream[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname-short} includes an embedded Kueue component for managing distributed workloads. In the next release, the embedded Kueue component will be deprecated and Kueue will be provided through {rhbok-productname}, which is installed and managed by the {rhbok-productname} Operator.

You cannot install both the embedded Kueue and the {rhbok-productname} Operator on the same cluster because this creates conflicting controllers that manage the same resources.

{productname-short} does not automatically migrate existing workloads to {rhbok-productname}. Cluster administrators must manually migrate from the embedded Kueue to the {rhbok-productname} Operator to ensure workloads continue using queue management after upgrading.

{productname-short} 2.23 and earlier versions include an embedded Kueue component for managing distributed workloads. Starting with {productname-short} 2.24, the embedded Kueue component will be deprecated and Kueue will be provided through {rhbok-productname}, which is installed and managed by the {rhbok-productname} Operator.

You cannot install both the embedded Kueue and the {rhbok-productname} Operator on the same cluster because this creates conflicting controllers that manage the same resources.

{productname-short} does not automatically migrate existing workloads to {rhbok-productname}. Cluster administrators must manually migrate from the embedded Kueue to the {rhbok-productname} Operator to ensure workloads continue using queue management after upgrading. 

This configuration is currently supported in {productname-short} {vernum} as a Technology Preview feature. For more information, see _Migrating to the {rhbok-productname} Operator_.

Technology Preview features are not supported with {org-name} production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
{org-name} does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
